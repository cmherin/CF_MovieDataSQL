This code reflects learning in creating CTE's

This code pulls out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country, also showing customer count per country.

WITH top_5_customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, amount) AS
(SELECT A. customer_id, B. first_name, B. last_name, E. country, D. city, SUM (A. amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A	
	INNER JOIN customer B ON A. customer_id = B. customer_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON B. address_id = C. address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON C. city_id = D. city_id

GROUP BY A. customer_id, B. first_name, B. last_name, E. country, D. city, A. amount
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
